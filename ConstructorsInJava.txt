What is an instance?
- an instance is an object created from a class blueprint
- from blue prints it is possible to create an object


Constructors have the same name as the class

Ex.:
public Triangle(){

}

"this" key word is used to access the attribute variable.

Ex.:
public Triangle(double base, double height, double sideLenOne, double sideLenTwo, double sideLenThree){
  this.base = base;
  this.height = height;
  this.sideLenOne = sideLenOne;
  this.sideLenTwo = sideLenTwo;
  this.sideLenThree = sideLenThree;
}

need to use the "new" keyword

Triangle triangleA = new Triangle(15, 8, 15, 8, 17);
Triangle triangleB =  new Triangle (2, 3, 4, 4, 4);

Trinagle above is a type of data type now.
